## What I Have Submitted

### Exercise 1 – Design Patterns

I implemented **six use cases** to show my understanding of different design patterns:

* **Observer Pattern:** University alert system
* **Strategy Pattern:** Vehicle operational modes
* **Singleton Pattern:** Centralized voting system
* **Factory Pattern:** AI model factory
* **Decorator Pattern:** Online learning badges
* **Proxy Pattern:** Large dataset loader with caching and access control

Each pattern is implemented with simple analogies, clear Java code, and interactive console demos.
